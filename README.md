Tektite
=======

Intended to be a fairly up-to-date version of TacoShell, now more or less modulized. The name comes from the
[lunar origin theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tektite#Nonterrestrial_source_theories) of tektites.

At the moment, this is just a TODO list, since everything is a bit scattered, some modules have both a 5.1 and JIT
version, and I haven't had a chance / excuse to play with 5.2 at all.

Basically, everything in my [Corona SDK snippets](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/corona-sdk-snippets) repository is up
to date with respect to 5.1.

At the moment, most of the JIT stuff is in my [UFO](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/ufo) fork.

There's a lot of stuff in [TacoShell](https://github.com/XibalbaStudios/TacoShell) and [Marabunta](https://github.com/XibalbaStudios/Marabunta)
that could stand to be folded in, but generally anything that isn't in the previously mentioned repos in updated form hasn't been
touched, since lately I've either been trying to cooperate with another framework or not able to use Lua at all. :cry:

So, at some point I'll try to bring this and that together.

There's no specific unifying philosophy behind the modules, since I add a lot of curosities and experimental stuff.
But the ideal goal would be to limit the dependencies so modules could be grabbed on-demand.

Details in the wiki.
